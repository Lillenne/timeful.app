# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. Start Listmonk services:
#    docker compose up -d listmonk-db listmonk
#
# 2. Initialize the database (first time only):
#    docker compose exec listmonk ./listmonk --install
#    (or: docker compose run --rm listmonk ./listmonk --install)
#    When prompted, type 'y' to confirm installation
#
# 3. Access Listmonk admin interface:
#    http://localhost:9000
#    Username: admin
#    Password: listmonk
#
# 4. IMMEDIATELY change the admin password:
#    - Log in with default credentials above
#    - Go to Settings → Users
#    - Update the admin password to a strong password
#
# 5. (Optional) Update this config file with new credentials and database password:
#    - Edit this file with your new passwords
#    - Restart Listmonk: docker compose restart listmonk
#
# ============================================================================
# PRODUCTION SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================================
#
# For production deployments, consider:
# 1. Use strong, unique passwords (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
# 2. Set LISTMONK_DB_PASSWORD in .env to a secure password
# 3. Update this config file to match the .env password
# 4. Consider using Docker secrets for sensitive values
# 5. Enable SSL for database connections if using external PostgreSQL
# 6. Regularly backup the PostgreSQL database
# 7. Keep Listmonk and PostgreSQL images updated
